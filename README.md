# Fortran Standard Library

## Scope

The goal of the Fortran Standard Library is to achieve the following general scope:

* Utilities
    * Containers
    * Algorithms
    * Strings
    * Files
    * OS/Environment integration
    * Unit testing & assertions stuff
    * Logging
    * Searching and sorting
* Mathematics
    * Linear algebra (`eig`, `solve`, ...)
    * Sparse matrices
    * Special functions (spherical harmonics, hypergeometric functions, ...)
    * FFT
    * Random numbers
    * Statistics
    * ODE solvers
    * Numerical integration (Gauss-Legendre points and weights and other algorithms)
    * Optimization (root finding, ...)
