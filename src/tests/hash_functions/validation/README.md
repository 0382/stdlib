The validation directory contains code to validate the Fortran hash functions against the original C/C++ codes. It consists of three executable applications:

* `generate_key_array.f90` - creates a file containing 2048 random 8 bit integers.

* `generate_hash_arrays.cpp` - reads the file generated by `generate_key_array.f90` and uses its contents to generate 2049 hashes for each hash algorithm and outputs files containing the hashes.

* `hash_validity_test.f90`- reads the file generated by `generate_key_array.f90` and uses its contents to generate 2049 hashes for each hash algorithm and compares the result with the corresponding outputs of `generate_hash_arrays.cpp` reporting if the outputs are not equal.

Note the C code for nmhash assumes that the C compiler is either gcc or MSVC, and will not compile with the Intel C compiler.
